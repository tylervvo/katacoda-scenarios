*This can be any type of data that you consider to be leading indicators of your top-level metrics*

Let's copy some pre-built RUM graphs: 
- Navigate to **RUM Explorer** under UX Monitoring or go to `https://app.datadoghq.com/rum/explorer`{{copy}}
- Click **Dashboards** â†’ **Performance**
- Choose the graphs that might explain changes in your top-level metrics

*If your not seeing any RUM data, make sure to click around in the page to start seeing real-time data*

Let's also copy some re-built Docker graphs:
- Navigate to **Dashboard List** under Dashboards and find **Docker - Overview** or go to `https://app.datadoghq.com/screen/integration/52/docker---overview`{{copy}}
